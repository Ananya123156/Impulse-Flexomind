# IMPULSE FLEXOMIND 
### Brain-Controlled Prosthetic Arm using Non-Invasive EEG

## Project Overview
IMPULSE FLEXOMIND is a Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) based prosthetic arm system designed to assist individuals with upper-limb amputations or severe motor impairments.

The system captures EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals using a non-invasive BioAmp headband, processes neural intent through signal conditioning and machine learning techniques, and translates user thoughts into real-time prosthetic arm movements.

This project integrates:
- Brain–Computer Interface (BCI)
- Embedded Systems (Arduino)
- Signal Processing
- Machine Learning
- Robotic Actuation
- IoT Connectivity
